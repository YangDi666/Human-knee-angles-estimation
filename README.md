# Human-knee-angles-estimation
Knee flexion/extension angles estimation for a person who walks towards an RGB-D camera

- Di Yang

### Resources
- 220 RGB-D videos (RGB: 1920 * 1080, D: 512 * 424 16bits)
- Vicon information (100Hz)
### Objectives 
- SK 2D/3D estimation with the RGB videos by deep learning algorithmes (LCR-NET/OpenPose/PifPaf)
- 3D Reconstruction with Depth map and 2D pose
- Plot the curves of variations of 3D knee angles for the videos
- Walking model construction (Angles+/Angles++) for the improvement of the curves
